# Geospatial Data Management and Visualization Application

## Overview
This is a full-stack web application for managing and visualizing geospatial data. The application provides tools for users to upload and visualize GeoJSON/KML and TIFF files on a map using Mapbox. It also includes features such as shape drawing, distance measurement, and point marker management. The application is built with a **Vue.js** or **Next.js** frontend and a backend in a language of your choice.

---

## Features
### User Management and Data Upload
- User account creation and authentication.
- Upload and render GeoJSON/KML and TIFF files on the map.
- Show/hide uploaded datasets according to user preferences.

### Drawing and Editing Shapes
- Draw custom shapes (polygons, lines, etc.) directly on the map.
- Save and edit drawn shapes later.

### Hover Card Information
- Display a mini card with relevant information when hovering over rendered files or shapes.

### Distance Measurement
- Measure distances on the map in both kilometers and miles.
- Display the distance dynamically during the measurement.

### Point Marker Management
- Add, save, delete, and move (drag-and-drop) point markers on the map.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Vue.js or Next.js
- **Backend**: Language of your choice (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.)
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Mapbox
- **Geospatial Libraries**: Turf.js (for distance measurement and geospatial operations)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension (for geospatial data storage) or another database of choice
- **Version Control**: Git (hosted on GitHub)

---

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
2. **Database**: Set up PostgreSQL or the database you choose.
3. **Backend Dependencies**: Install the required backend dependencies.
4. **Frontend Dependencies**: Install Vue.js/Next.js dependencies.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shashank7753/Geo_data.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in both the frontend and backend directories.
   - Add configuration settings such as database connection strings, Mapbox API key, etc.

4. Start the application:
   

   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Access the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Error Handling and Validation
- Robust validation of uploaded files (GeoJSON, KML, TIFF) to ensure correct formats.
- Proper error messages for user actions such as login failures or unsupported file uploads.
- Backend exception handling with meaningful error responses.

---

## Responsive Design
- The application is designed to work seamlessly across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

---

## Security Measures
- Secure user authentication using hashed passwords.
- Protection against SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- HTTPS configuration for secure data transmission.

---

## Additional Features
- **Clustered Markers**: Automatically group nearby point markers for better visualization.
- **Heatmaps**: Visualize geospatial data density using heatmaps.
- **Export Features**: Export drawn shapes or selected datasets as GeoJSON files.
